## A Fully functional website.

This is a project that we had to review and make some changes to that tag /elements that would work better then just divs on the pages
and make sure that all the links work.

- fixed and veifed that all links work
- changed the tag/ elements in the HTML code
- Review the Css code and made some minor changes
