# ChallengeOne

## A Fully functional website.

For this project I reviewed the links and made changes to the elements to identify each section for the HTML.
and make sure that all the links work.

- I verified that all the links work and fixed any that didn't work.
- I reviewed the Css code and made some minor changes.

* I added a photo to show how the website would look
